### Coding styles I used:

### What I learned:
1. Tailwind CSS is relatively easy to setup. It has classes you tail into HTML elements but Tailwind doesn't have functionality to view the website in the browser by a server.
2. You can set breakpoints for the website and color variables in a JSON file.
3. It's simply another framework with it's own ways of building websites. It's for those who compare frameworks as tools often and develop preferences or quirks to what tools to use to build a website. It's like another tool in the gigantic industry of CSS frameworks.
